Question.create(title: "Rines hplus on", description: "Formation Face is a true profile rim. Without any stress points in the sidewall, the uniform triangle shape improves the rim's lateral stiffness in comparison to SL42. The simple profile shape also saves weight by reducing the distance between the bead hook and the spoke bed. Because of the thinness of the sidewalls, technical hurdles had to be overcome in engineering a welded joint. Despite the profile height, we were able to reduce the weight to around 615 grams (plus or minus 15 grams) using the G609 aluminum alloy which is also 30 percent stronger than the 6061 aluminum alloy used in standard rim manufacture.
